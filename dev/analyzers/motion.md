# Motion review (phases that change animation)

**Question:** Does every animation this change adds or alters earn its place — right frequency,
easing, duration and origin, interruptible, cheap to render, and respectful of reduced motion?

Scope: the changed files that contain a sweep hit, plus the components that trigger those
animations (to judge how often a user sees them).

## Standard

The yardstick is Emil Kowalski's animation standards
([emilkowalski/skills](https://github.com/emilkowalski/skills)). **Read it from disk at run time,
do not work from memory:**

```
$DEV_DESIGN_DIR/emil/skills/review-animations/STANDARDS.md   (default DEV_DESIGN_DIR=~/.claude/dev-design)
```

If the file is missing, stop and return `Result: skipped: animation standards not found` — the gate
ticks the checkbox with evidence `skipped: <reason>`, never as a pass. Cite the standard's values (curves,
durations, frequency table) in findings instead of approximating them.

## Sweep

Probe the scope for these and judge every hit:

- **CSS:** `transition`, `animation`, `@keyframes`, `will-change`, `transform` inside `:hover` or
  state selectors, `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **JS/TS animation libraries:** `motion.` (Motion/Framer Motion components), `animate(`,
  `useSpring`/`useTransition`, `gsap.`, `element.animate(`.
- **React Native / Expo:** `withSpring`, `withTiming`, `Animated.`, `LayoutAnimation`.
- **SwiftUI:** `withAnimation`, `.animation(`, `.transition(`.

## Judge each candidate

For each hit, against the standard:

1. **Should it animate at all?** How often does a user see it (frequency table)? Is it triggered by
   the keyboard? A command palette or list navigation that animates is a finding.
2. **Easing and duration.** Enter/exit, on-screen movement, hover and constant motion each have a
   prescribed curve; `ease-in` on UI and durations outside the standard's ranges are findings.
3. **Origin and physics.** Popovers scale from their trigger (modals stay centred); nothing
   scales from 0; springs where the standard asks for them.
4. **Interruption.** Can the user reverse it mid-way (transitions vs. keyframes), does it block
   input while running?
5. **Performance.** Only `transform` and `opacity` animated; no layout properties (`width`,
   `height`, `top`, `left`, `margin`) on frequent motion.
6. **Reduced motion.** Under `prefers-reduced-motion` (or the platform equivalent) movement and
   position changes are removed; transitions that aid comprehension (fades) may stay.

## Critical when

Motion that hides or delays content a user needs (input blocked until an animation ends), large or
looping movement with no reduced-motion alternative, or animation of layout properties on a path
that runs continuously (scroll, drag, list rendering) and visibly janks. Everything else is a note.
